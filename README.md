This contains official implementation for Extended 2D Volumetric Consensus Hippocampus Segmentation

We made this version of the code public for it to be available for reviewers/chairs with our current MIDL2019 submission: 
Authors: Diedre Carmo, Bruna Silva, Clarissa Yasuda, Leticia Rittner, Roberto Lotufo
Title: Extended 2D Volumetric Consensus Hippocampus Segmentation

We plan to implement quality of life features for external use soon. Currently most configuration options are arguments or hardcoded. Documentation is on the way.

Improvements are also still being made privately.

Thank you!
